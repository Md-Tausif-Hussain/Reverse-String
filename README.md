Reverse String in C

Description

This C program reverses a given string using an in-place swapping approach. The function Reverse() takes a character array and its length as input, then swaps characters to reverse the string.

How It Works

The Reverse() function swaps characters from the beginning and end of the string, moving toward the center.

The main() function initializes a character array, calls Reverse(), and prints the reversed string.
